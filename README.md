# Testing Practice Repository

This repository is designed for testing practice, incorporating Jest, Babel, and Node.js. The functions and objects in the `functions` directory are meant to be tested, including:

- `capitalize.js`
- `reverseString.js`
- `calculator.js` (an object with four functions: `add`, `subtract`, `divide`, `multiply`)
- `caesarCipher.js`
- `analyzeArray.js`

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   `git clone https://github.com/noName-256/odin-testing-practice.git`

2. Install dependencies:

   `npm install`

3. Run the tests:

   `npm test`

## Project Structure

- _functions:_ This directory contains the functions and objects to be tested.

- _test:_ This directory houses the corresponding test files for the functions in the `functions` directory.

## Running Tests

Execute the following command to run the tests:

`npm test`

## Adding New Tests

Expand the test suite by adding new test files or enhancing existing ones in the `test` directory. Follow Jest conventions for test file naming (e.g., `capitalize.test.js`).
